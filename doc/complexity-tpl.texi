This file documents Complexity version [= version =].  It is a tool designed
for analyzing the complexity of ``C'' program functions.  It is very similar
to the McCabe scoring, but addresses several issues not considered in that
scoring scheme.

This edition documents version [=(. ver-update)=]

@node    Example Output
@chapter Example Output
@cindex  Example Output

This is a self-referential example. This output was obtained by
going into the complexity source directory and running the command:
@example
[=`
src=\`cd ${top_srcdir}/src && pwd\`
bld=\`cd ${top_builddir}/src && pwd\`
cmd='complexity --histogram --score --thresh=3'
echo "$cmd *.c"
`=]
@end example

The @code{--threshold} is set to three because all of the functions
score below the default threshold of 30.  It is not zero because
there are too many trivial (0, 1 or 2) functions for a short example.

@noindent
This results in:

@example
[=`
cd ${src}
if test -f opts.c
then optsc=
else optsc=${bld}/opts.c
fi
eval ${bld}/${cmd} *.c $optsc | sed 's/\\(.\\{66\\}\\).*/\\1/'
`=]
